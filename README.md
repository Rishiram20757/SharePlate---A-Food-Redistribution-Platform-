# About this project

Food wastage and hunger are two major issues that need immediate attention. While tons of food are discarded daily, many people struggle to find a meal. 

SharePlate is a web-based food redistribution platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The platform connects food donors such as restaurants, hotels and individuals with NGOs that request and distribute food to beneficiaries. Delivery personnel help ensure seamless transportation of food from donors to NGOs.

The system provides a structured and transparent way for food donations, making the process efficient and hassle-free. By leveraging technology, SharePlate aims to reduce food waste and support NGOs in fulfilling food requests and contribute to a sustainable solution for food insecurity.
